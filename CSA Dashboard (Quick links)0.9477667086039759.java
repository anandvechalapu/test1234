2. Service: This class will be responsible for implementing the business logic associated with the CSA dashboard menu. It will also be responsible for validating the user input, performing the appropriate operations, and returning the appropriate response to the controller.

3. Repository: This class will be responsible for managing the data associated with the CSA dashboard menu. It will also be responsible for persisting the data, querying the data, and returning the appropriate response to the service.
